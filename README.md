# üß¨ Project 1 [Thyroid Cancer]
### Exploratory Data Analysis + Classification (Random Forest)

<hr>

New data analytics company has recently opened in my hometown, and started recruiting data scientists to conduct research in public healthcare (PH). One month later, the company had only 1 data analyst (me) due to the ‚Äúbudget constraints‚Äù.

The Ministry of Healthcare provided a dataset of patient demographics and blood test results along with Thyroid disease diagnostic, and requested to create a machine learning model aiming to predict the recurrence of well differentiated thyroid cancer.

Surprisingly, the Ministry also requested to share our source code of machine learning model and exploratory data analysis with clear visualizations. It means that I need to document each step to requesters. So, let‚Äôs start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses.
