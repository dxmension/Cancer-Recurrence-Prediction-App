# üß¨ Project 1 [Thyroid Cancer]
### Exploratory Data Analysis + Classification (Random Forest)

<hr>

### Business Case
<hr>

New data analytics company has recently opened in my hometown, and started recruiting data scientists to conduct research in public healthcare (PH). One month later, the company had only 1 data analyst (me) due to the ‚Äúbudget constraints‚Äù.

The Ministry of Healthcare provided a dataset of patient demographics and blood test results along with Thyroid disease diagnostic, and requested to create a machine learning model aiming to predict the recurrence of well differentiated thyroid cancer.

Surprisingly, the Ministry also requested to share our source code of machine learning model and exploratory data analysis with clear visualizations. It means that I need to document each step to requesters. So, let‚Äôs start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses.

### Objective
<hr>

Before the modeling step, it is essential to focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to maintain a clear data analysis pipeline. So, I have to be patient towards research and data understanding. Along the way of EDA, I believe that new testable hypotheses could occur to strengthen further modeling. 


### Methods
<hr>

For statistics, I used pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and other libraries to handle questions based on the final results.

For plotting/visualizations - matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly are used to display patterns and make it more clear and concise. 

Streamlit was used to deploy ML models to demonstrate them interactively in real time.

P.S. I left valuable markdowns and comments to demonstrate how everything works and showcase key findings, if it is found on the particular step.

### Dataset Description
<hr>

This data set contains 13 clinicopathologic features aiming to predict recurrence of well differentiated thyroid cancer. The data set was collected in duration of 15 years and each patient was followed for at least 10 years.

no. rows: 383
no. columns: 17

### Challenges
<hr>

Due to a little domain knowledge in medicine, I did some research on thyroid cancers in advance using various resources to make a picture a bit clearer.

NIH (National Institute of Health)
Mayo Clinic
Cleveland Clinic

Such an approach enables me to make adequate hypotheses and move forward key observations.
